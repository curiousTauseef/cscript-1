Simple scripts to allow C/C++ (and maybe other things) to act like bash scripts

Installation:
Put all the cscript_* files into a directory that is on your path that source (or . if you prefer) can find.
I put mine in /usr/local/bin but that requires you are root. If you have your own ~/bin directory you won't
need root, but it does need to be on your path.

Usage:
See example.c

The idea is to put this boilerplate in front of your C/C++ program:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
#if 0
source cscript_XXX
#endif

Where XXX is one of the items below.

There are three cscript_ files although you can make your own:

* cscript_simplec - Runs gcc on C code with -O3 option (or use CCOPTS
* cscript_simplecpp - Same as simplec, but use g++
* cscript_makefile - Runs makefile (e.g., example.c.make)
